# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
A school board representative requested an analysis of their school districtâ€™s standardized testing scores to provide insight about performance trends and patterns. This analysis will impact decisions regarding school's budgets and priorities. The school board was later notified that there was suspect of academic dishonesty within the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. These results were requested to be removed and analyzed again for comparison.

The original analysis showed Thomas High School with some of the top percentages in math and reading, including an overall passing percentage of about 91%. Once the 9th grade students were suspected of academic dishonesty their results were removed from the summary.
